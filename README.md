This game involves teams of multiple players with mobile devices intereacting with the USC-CCI testbed and forming a network. Using only Bluetooth to connect to the sensors, the players must act as the link between one node and the next one, and acting like a relay, deliver the data to the destination. One team member will pick up data from one sensor box and deliver it to another sensor box. To reduce latency time, the player should run to the next node and the next player will be waiting to pick up the data right after the first player delivers it to the node. The team with the smallest latency time wins!
